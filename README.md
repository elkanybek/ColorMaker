# ChromaBlend
> This project was developed for JacHacks hackathon at John Abbott College in 2024. 

ChromaBlend is an innovative tool designed to help art students and creators work with colors in their art projects. Using AI technology, it allows users to upload sketches or pictures of their artwork and identifies the colors being used in the image. It's an educational and practical tool designed specifically for artists.

### What It Does

ChromaBlend allows users to:

- Create an account and save their art projects.
- Upload sketches or pictures of their artworks.
- Automatically analyze the image to identify the colors used.
- Retrieve detailed information about the colors in the image (e.g., RGB, Hex, and other color properties).

Itâ€™s designed to help artists understand color palettes, make informed decisions about their artwork, and enhance their creativity.

##### Project was developped by Elsana Kanybek, Joseph Lehman, Patricia Dolecki and Youssef Azmires.
